A fork of Statpress Visitors for very limited space like there is in Free hosting.


== Description ==

* This plugin (a lite fork of StatPress Visitors) shows the real-time statistics on your blog. It collects information about visitors, spiders, search keywords, feeds, browsers, OS, etc., as Statpress Visitors. 

* Daily stat allows you to make stat on the free web hosting that **prohibit** them by **autodelete** records **older** than **2** **days** and by the SQL queries optimisation who significantly **reduces** the number of **SQL** **queries.**

**NEW** **in** **1.2.x :**
* **SQL** queries **optimization** in the pages "Visitors Spy" and "Spy Bot" by the use of the natural index of the datatable. Now these pages are made in **only** **one** **SQL** **query**. The previous versions need as many SQL queries that there is IP or Bot displayed on the page. The speed is 3 times faster. 
* Better detection of **Facebook** referrer. In this case, in previous versions, all page views were called "fb_xd_fragment", now, their real name is displayed.
* Added smalls **Icons** of browsers and OS in the Main "Overview" page.
* Display last 40, pages, referrer, searchs terms and spider in the "Overview" page.

**Still** **in** **1.2.x :**
* Added a **new** **way** to **count** the **RSS** feed by IP. Thus, there are two separate counts of RSS: as far as total subscription on every page (pageviews feeds), as far as visitors subscribers(visitors feeds).
  
* The **"yesterday" page show you the number of "unique visitors", "page views", subscriptions to "RSS visitors feeds", subscriptions to "RSS pageviews feeds"  and "search engines" (spider) for each page and posts (with or without visits) of your website at the date of yesterday.
  
* In the options page you can choose the number of IP displayed on "Visitor Spy" page (20, 50 or 100) and the number of visits for each IP (20, 50 or 100).

* The **"spy robots"** lets you know which pages were indexed by search robots.

* The **"referrer"** page shows what referrer bring the most visitors to your website.

= DB Table maintenance =

Daily stat automatically delete older records than 2 days to have a very short database and **automaticaly** **optimise** the daily-stat datatable after the removal of olds datas.

= Daily Stat Widget / Daily_Stat_Print function =

The widget is customizable. These are the available variables:
* %today% - date of today
* %visitorsyesterday% - Visitors yesterday
* %visitorstoday% - Visitors today
* %pageviewstoday% - Pageviews today

Put it whereever you want the details to be displayed in your template. Remember, as this is PHP, it needs to be surrounded by PHP-Tags!

== Installation ==
Unzip file and Upload "Daily-stat" directory in wp-content/plugins/ . Then just activate it on your plugin management page.
That's it, you're done!

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= What is the difference between "visitors Feeds" and "Pageviews feeds"? =

Quite simply, if a single visitor subscribed to RSS feeds on pages 5, then "Visitors Feeds" is 1 and "Pageviews Feeds" is 5.
= Why "Visitors Feeds" and "pageviews feeds" are not the same account in the "yesterday" and  "Main Overview" pages ? =

This is because the calculations are not the same!
On the "Main Overview", all pages are counted, even those that are automatically generated by WordPress (category, etc.).
On the "Yesterday", only the pages you have actually written and that are stored in your database are taken into account, those generated by WordPress are not counted.
= Isnâ€™t it possible to make it work with network of sites ? =
